# Study Projects Collection

This repository serves as a collection of various study projects, each maintained in a single file format optimized for LLM (Large Language Model) semantic search capabilities.

## Purpose

The projects have been intentionally consolidated into single-file codebases to facilitate:
- Easy semantic search across project contents
- Efficient LLM-based code analysis and understanding
- Quick reference and study purposes

## Structure

Each project is maintained in its own directory with a consolidated codebase, making it easier to analyze and search through the code using LLM-powered tools.
